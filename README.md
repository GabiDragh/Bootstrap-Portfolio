# Description

The current portfolio keeps elements from the previous week, while adding new ones. 
The About Me section is now included in the Hero/Jumbotron section as to avoid repetition/clash with the resume (resume needs updating, at the moment is added just for the link connection).

A skills section was added.
The Contact Me section has an added element where users can send an email to the website owner.
